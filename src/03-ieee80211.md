# IEEE 802.11

This is basically WLAN/Wi-Fi.

## Monitor Mode

Run the command (note that it will kill your internet connection) to switch to monitor mode:

```sh
airmon-ng start wlp4s0
```

This will create an interface `wlp4s0mon`.
Start a Wireshark capture on that interface.

You need to be on the right channel:

```sh
iwconfig wlp4s0mon channel 56
```

Note that you can remove the interface by running:

```sh
airmon-ng stop wlp4s0mon
```

## Channels

Network cards can listen on different channels with different frequencies.

You can see the channels by running `nmcli device wifi list`:

```
1C:ED:6F:B2:70:BC  examplenet                      Infra  11    270 Mbit/s  97      ▂▄▆█  WPA2
1C:ED:6F:B2:70:BD  examplenet                      Infra  52    405 Mbit/s  95      ▂▄▆█  WPA2
```

Channel 11 corresponds to the frequency range in the area of 2,4 GHz and channel 52 corresponds to a frequency range in the area of 5 GHz.

Note that these channels are centrally defined (not just for WLAN - if you want to learn something interesting, google TETRA, BOS and "Digitalfunk der Behörden und Organisationen mit Sicherheitsaufgaben" (BOSNet)).

## The Authentication Process

Let's say a station STA wants to authenticate with access point AP.

- STA sends an authenticaion request to AP
- AP send an authentication response to STA
- STA sends an association request to AP
- AP sends an association response to STA
- STA and AP exchange a 4-way handshake (4 KEY packets)

STA is now authenticated to AP.

Let's now look at such an exchange in detail.

### 4-Way Handshake

Here the actual authentication happens in 4 messages.

Message 1: AP sends the ANonce to STA.

Here the ANonce was:

```
3a4b19d360e946ffc039f98a811599ccb916631f7866f08f413caad6f240bd3b
```

Message 2: STA sends SNonce to AP.

Here the SNonce was:

```
f5ea43a088b5593425e5d93cfc5c0a8aef627d978ee72dc16545d63e6d7522d6
```

The PTK is constructed as follows:

```
PTK = PRF(PMK, "Pairwise key exchange", Min(AA, SPA) || Max(AA, SPA) || Min(ANonce, SNonce) || Max(ANonce, SNonce))
```

Example code:

```python
from hashlib import pbkdf2_hmac, sha1
import hmac
import hashlib

def to_bytes(num):
    return hex(num)[2:].encode("ascii")

def calculate_ptk(PMK, AA, SPA, ANonce, SNonce):
    MIN_AA_SPA = min(AA, SPA)
    MAX_AA_SPA = max(AA, SPA)
    MIN_ANonce_SNonce = min(ANonce, SNonce)
    MAX_ANonce_SNonce = max(ANonce, SNonce)

    PTK = b''
    for i in range(4):  # Iterate to generate 512 bits
        PTK += hmac.new(PMK, b"Pairwise key expansion" + b'\x00' + MIN_AA_SPA + MAX_AA_SPA + MIN_ANonce_SNonce + MAX_ANonce_SNonce + bytes([i]), hashlib.sha1).digest()

    # return PRF(PMK, b"Pairwise key expansion", MIN_AA_SPA + MAX_AA_SPA + MIN_ANonce_SNonce + MAX_ANonce_SNonce)
    return PTK[:64]


PSK = "Test1234!"
SSID = "examplenet"
PMK = pbkdf2_hmac('sha1', PSK.encode('ascii'), SSID.encode('ascii'), 4096, 32)
print("PMK")
print(PMK.hex())

AA = bytes.fromhex("1c:ed:6f:b2:70:bd".replace(":", ""))
SPA = bytes.fromhex("2c:db:07:40:9a:16".replace(":", ""))
ANonce = bytes.fromhex("3a4b19d360e946ffc039f98a811599ccb916631f7866f08f413caad6f240bd3b")
SNonce = bytes.fromhex("f5ea43a088b5593425e5d93cfc5c0a8aef627d978ee72dc16545d63e6d7522d6")

print("PTK")
print(calculate_ptk(PMK, AA, SPA, ANonce, SNonce).hex())
```

## Other Management Frames

### Probe Request

A probe request is sent by stations to discover available access points.

Example:

```
0000  00 00 38 00 2f 40 40 a0  20 08 00 a0 20 08 00 00   ··8·/@@·  ··· ···
0010  89 29 e7 03 00 00 00 00  00 02 99 09 a0 00 ce 00   ·)······ ········
0020  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  89 29 e7 03 00 00 00 00   ········ ·)······
0030  00 00 01 01 ce 00 bd 01  40 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff   ········ @·······
0040  ff ff e4 23 54 12 62 b7  ff ff ff ff ff ff 90 aa   ···#T·b· ········
0050  00 0d 67 69 67 61 63 75  62 65 2d 41 30 34 31 01   ··gigacu be-A041·

```

The first 56 bytes is a radiotap header (ends with `bd 01`) and is not really part of the standard - it basically provides additional context about how a packet was received.
The radiotap header are only added by Wireshark, they are not actually part of the sent packet.

The frame fields follow:

- `40` (= `0b01000000`) is 4 bits of subtype (`0b0100` = 4 = probe request) + 2 bits of type (`0b00` = 0 = management frame) + 2 bits of version (`0b00` = 0)
- `00` are the flags (we don't care about these for now)
- `00 00` is the duration
- `ff ff ff ff ff ff` is the destination address -> which is broadcast here (makes sense since it's a probe request)
- `e4 23 54 12 62 b7` is the source address -> note that this is not actually my source address (I captured a probe request from some other machine around me)
- `ff ff ff ff ff ff` is the BSSID
- `90 aa` is the sequence number + fragment number (sequence number `0xaa9` = 2729, fragment number `0x0` = 0)

Next we have the actual data:

- `00` is the tag number
- `0d` is the tag length
- `67 69 67 61 63 75  62 65 2d 41 30 34 31` is the SSID (this is `gigacube-A041`)
- the rest is info about the supported rates

### Probe Response

Here is a probe response:

```
0000   00 00 38 00 2f 40 40 a0 20 08 00 a0 20 08 00 00
0010   29 54 98 06 00 00 00 00 00 02 99 09 a0 00 b1 00
0020   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 29 54 98 06 00 00 00 00
0030   00 00 01 01 af 00 ad 01 50 08 3a 01 0c 9a 3c 6f
0040   f5 95 1e e8 29 e1 1e 11 1e e8 29 e1 1e 11 10 3c
0050   e5 30 12 27 9d 0e 00 00 64 00 31 14 00 05 46 43

0080   46 05 73 d0 00 00 0c 2d 1a ac 41 1b ff ff ff 00
0090   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

00c0   00 2c 01 c8 00 14 00 05 00 19 00 7f 08 05 00 0f
00d0   02 00 00 00 40 dd 18 00 50 f2 02 01 01 00 00 03
00e0   a4 00 00 27 a4 00 00 42 43 5e 00 62 32 2f 00 dd
00f0   09 00 03 7f 01 01 00 00 ff 7f dd 13 00 15 6d 00
0100   01 01 00 01 02 37 e5 81 06 18 e8 29 e0 1e 11 dd
0110   16 8c fd f0 04 00 00 49 00 00 03 02 09 72 01 00
0120   00 00 00 3f 00 00 00 30 14 01 00 00 0f ac 04 01
0130   00 00 0f ac 04 01 00 00 0f ac 02 00 00 dd 08 8c
0140   fd f0 01 01 02 01 00
```

Again the first 56 bytes is the radiotap header.

Next, the probe response header follows:

```
0000  50 08 3a 01 0c 9a 3c 6f  f5 95 1e e8 29 e1 1e 11
0010  1e e8 29 e1 1e 11 10 3c
```

- `50` is subtype `0b1010` + type `0b00` + version `0b00` (management frame + probe response)
- `08` is flags (we don't care about this)
- `3a 01` is duration
- `0c 9a 3c 6f f5 95` is receiver address
- `1e e8 29 e1 1e 11` is the trasmitter address
- `1e e8 29 e1 1e 11` (the second one) is the source address
- `10 3c` are the sequence number + fragment number

After the probe response header the management frame data follows which basically has:

- timestamp
- beacon interval
- capabilities information
- etc (a lot of various settings that we don't care about right now)

### Beacon Frame

Periodically sent out by the access station.
This is very similar to the probe response (except that it doesn't actually respond to some probe request).
