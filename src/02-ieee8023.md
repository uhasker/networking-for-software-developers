# IEEE 802.3

## Overview

The IEEE 802.3 standard defines the link layer protocol for wired Ethernet.
Basically, if you plugin in a device into something using an Ethernet cable, IEEE 802.3 will be involved.

## MAC Addresses

A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to an interface.
It is typically written as six groups of two hex digits, e.g. `12:34:56:78:9a:bc`.

MAC addresses of NICs are often given by the manufacturer (however, you can change them).
The address typically includes the organizationally unique identifier (OUI).
This means that if you have a (real) MAC address, you can actually infer a few things about the device that crafted the packet.

The `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` address is the brodcast MAC address.

## Sending an IEEE802.3 Packet

If you want to follow along, you will need:

- a switch
- two ethernet cables
- two computing devices with Ethernet interfaces

In our running example, we will use two devices with Ubuntu installed.

Let's check the interfaces on the first device:

```sh
ip link
```

Check the status of your Ethernet interface (e.g. `enp5s0`).
It will probably be `DOWN` (unless you are already connected to Ethernet).

Connect the first laptop to the switch using an Ethernet cable and run `ip link` again.
The status should now be `UP`.

Start `wireshark` on the Ethernet interface.

Now let's send a broadcast frame from device 1.
Find out your source address by looking at the output of `ip link`.
For example, if you see this:

```
2: enp5s0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 6c:24:08:e3:a2:ce brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

Then your source MAC address is `6c:24:08:e3:a2:ce`.

Create a Python script `ether_send.py` containing this code on device 1:

```python
from scapy.all import Ether, sendp

# You will need to replace this with your source address
src_addr = "6c:24:08:e3:a2:ce"
dst_addr = "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff"

# Replace this with your actual interface name
iface = "enp5s0"

payload = "Hello, world!"

# Craft an Ethernet frame
frame = Ether(dst=dst_addr, src=src_addr, type=0x1234) / payload

# Send the frame on the interface
sendp(frame, iface=iface)
```

This will simply create a raw Ethernet packet with the payload containing the bytes that encode `"Hello, world!"`.
Note that the destination is the broadcast address, so no matter what the MAC address of device 2 is, it will receive it.

Next create this Python script `ether_recv.py` on device 2 which will receive the packet:

```python
from scapy.all import *

# Replace this with your actual interface name
iface = "enp5s0"

def handle_packet(packet):
    if packet.haslayer(Raw):
        payload = packet[Raw].load
        print("Received Ethernet frame:")
        print(payload)

# Start sniffing on the specified interface
sniff(iface=iface, prn=handle_packet)
```

Now run `python ether_send.py` on device 2 and then `python ether_recv.py` on device 1 (in that order of course).
You should see that device 2 receives the packet.

You should also see that Wireshark has captured the packet.

## IEEE 802.3 Frame

Here is the frame (yours might be slightly different depending on the source address):

```
0000  ff ff ff ff ff ff 6c 24  08 e3 a2 ce 12 34 48 65   ······l$ ·····4He
0010  6c 6c 6f 2c 20 77 6f 72  6c 64                     llo, wor ld
```

Note that Wireshark doesn't show the preamble and the SFD (Start Frame Delimiter).
These are used to signal the start of the frame and are necessary for physical reasons, which we will ignore for now (basically it has do with clock synchronization).

The first 6 bytes are the MAC destination address (`ff ff ff ff ff ff` in this case).
The next 6 bytes are the MAC source address (`6c 24  08 e3 a2 ce` in this case).
This is followed by 2 bytes containing the Ethernet type or length (`12 34` in this case).

Finally we have the payload.
Here it is `48 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 77 6f 72 6c 64` which is a binary encoding of `"Hello, world!"`.

Finally, we could also have included a frame check sequence, which we didn't do here.

## A Virtual Setup

One big part of this book is about understanding how virtual network setups are used.

### Virtual Ethernet Pair

First, let's simply create a virtual ethernet pair:

```sh
ip link add vethA type veth peer name vethB
```

The `veth` devices are virtual Ethernet devices.
They are always created in interconnected pairs - packets transmitted on one device in the pair are immediately received on the other device.
The main ideas is to communicate between different network namespaces - however here we will simply use them for learning purposes.

Look at the output of `ip link show` (of course your addresses will be different):

```
14: vethB@vethA: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 4a:29:fc:57:c2:7c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
15: vethA@vethB: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 22:53:20:25:b5:81 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

Bring the interfaces up:

```sh
ip link set vethA up
ip link set vethB up
```

Let's try to send a packet from `vethA`:

```python
from scapy.all import Ether, sendp

# You will need to replace this with your source address
src_addr = "22:53:20:25:b5:81"
dst_addr = "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff"

iface = "vethA"

payload = "Hello, world!"

# Craft an Ethernet frame
frame = Ether(dst=dst_addr, src=src_addr, type=0x1234) / payload

# Send the frame on the interface
sendp(frame, iface=iface)
```

We again need to receive:

```python
from scapy.all import *

iface = "vethB"

def handle_packet(packet):
    if packet.haslayer(Raw):
        payload = packet[Raw].load
        print("Received Ethernet frame:")
        print(payload)

# Start sniffing on the specified interface
sniff(iface=iface, prn=handle_packet)
```

If you start a capture on `vethA`, you will see the packets.
This is called point-to-point communication.

> Important note: Because of the way the `veth` devices work, the destination address doesn't actually matter - `vethB` will always receive the packet.

After you're done, delete `vethA` and `vethB`:

```sh
ip link delete vethA
```

Note that deleting any virtual ethernet interface will delete the pair.

### Virtual Bridge

The above setup works for 2 interfaces, but doesn't for 3 interfaces.
Here we would need to create a virtual bridge.

You can view all available bridges like this:

```sh
brctl show
```

Create a new ethernet bridge:

```sh
brctl addbr mybridge
```

Bring the device up (activate the bridge):

```sh
ip link set mybridge up
```

Create pairs of virtual Ethernet devices:

```sh
ip link add dev vethA type veth peer name vethA-br
ip link add dev vethB type veth peer name vethB-br
ip link add dev vethC type veth peer name vethC-br
```

One end of each pair will be our interface, where we send and/or receive packets, the other end is what we attach to the bridge.

Attach the virtual devices to bridge:

```sh
brctl addif mybridge vethA-br
brctl addif mybridge vethB-br
brctl addif mybridge vethC-br
```

Bring up the `veth` devices:

```sh
ip link set vethA up
ip link set vethA-br up
ip link set vethB up
ip link set vethB-br up
ip link set vethC up
ip link set vethC-br up
```

Let's have a look at the output of `ip link show`:

```
16: mybridge: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether a6:78:e2:33:5d:27 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
17: vethA-br@vethA: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master mybridge state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether da:31:60:94:36:47 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
18: vethA@vethA-br: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 22:53:20:25:b5:81 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
19: vethB-br@vethB: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master mybridge state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 6a:31:46:ab:e5:13 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
20: vethB@vethB-br: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 4a:29:fc:57:c2:7c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
21: vethC-br@vethC: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master mybridge state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 4e:cd:c4:33:16:22 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
22: vethC@vethC-br: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 6e:b0:0f:93:82:0a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

Try starting the receive script on `vethB` and `vethC` and send a packet from `vethA` to the broadcast address.
You will see that both `vethB` and `vethC` receive the packet.

Now try sending the packet to the `vethC` destination address.
Only `vethC` will receive the packet.

After you're done, again delete everything:

```sh
ip link delete vethA
ip link delete vethB
ip link delete vethC
brctl delbr mybridge
```

## Maximum Transmission Unit

The MTU (maximum transmission unit) is the size of the largest PDU (protocol data unit) that can be communicated in a single transaction.
For Ethernet it's approximately the maximum frame size.

TODO: Example of MTU in scapy

## Security Considerations

Notice that we provide the source address ourselves.
This means that source addresses can't be trusted (this will be a theme).

Additionally you can receive Ethernet packets not meant for you (this will also be a theme).
